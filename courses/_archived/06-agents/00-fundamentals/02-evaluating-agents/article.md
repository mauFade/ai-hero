Evaluating the performance of agents is still an open question.

Agents have new modes of operation and so will have new modes of failures.

Agents often need to perform multiple steps to accomplish a task. And the accuracy decreases as the number of steps increases.

If the model's accuracy is 95% per step over 10 steps, the accuracy will drop to 60%.

Creating an event queue gives us other advantages. It becomes pretty easy to add a human in the loop.

We can add ourselves to the team. Agents should be able to send messages to us with suggested actions to take.

We can then decide whether to take the action or not, or perhaps reply to the agent with feedback before they propose the action agian.

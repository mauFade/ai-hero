There's no foolproof guide on how to select the best set of tools for your agent. Chameleon uses thirteen tools, Gorilla uses one thousand six hundred and forty-five tools.

It's hard for humans to master a large set of tools.

Giving agents a set of primitives which they can compose into larger tools is really key.

What do you do when you want a single entry point, But the LLM you're using can't handle the amount of tools you need?

So you can delegate a number of those tools to a second agent.

We can think of our agents as kind of in a startup phase. The boss the one you're speaking to, Still has some day to day responsibilities that aren't management. But they do delegate some of those responsibilities to their second in command.

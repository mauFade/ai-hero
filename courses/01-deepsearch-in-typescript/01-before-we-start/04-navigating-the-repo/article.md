Let's introduce you to the repo.

We're going to do that in a slightly unconventional way.

We're going to ask our coding assistants a bunch of questions. That way we'll get used to interacting with the coding assistant, and get a good overview of the tools at our disposal.

## Steps To Complete

- Open the directory `01-day-1-app` in your IDE
- Ask these questions, in turn:

```
Give me a high-level overview of this repo. What is it?
```

```
Show me some TailwindCSS code
```

```
How does this repo manage its database?
```

```
How do I migrate the database?
```

```
Show me the pre-built frontend components in this repo.
```

```
How do I run the app locally?
```

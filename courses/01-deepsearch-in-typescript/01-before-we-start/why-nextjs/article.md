I could have chosen any front end framework for this build.

Even right now you could probably strip out the next js stuff from this repo and rewrite it in React Router or tanstack/start or Svelte or nuxt.

I chose next simply because there is the most documentation available for it. Next is made by Vercel, Just like the aisdk.

That means that there is plenty of material of the two being used in combination.

With next you also get next auth out of the box, Which is a very simple way to set up authentication.

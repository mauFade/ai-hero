## What are we building?

We're building DeepSearch. It is an agentic search engine that uses a combination of LLMs and web search to answer questions.

You might know its cousin, DeepResearch. Whereas DeepResearch aims to give you a large, detailed report on a topic, DeepSearch is focused on giving concise answers to questions.

## Why DeepSearch, Not DeepResearch?

I chose DeepSearch over DeepResearch because most AI applications won't need the ability to generate content. Formatting reports and improving writing style is pretty niche.

However, reducing hallucinations and making LLM outputs trustworthy is something that's on the mind of almost every AI engineer out there. Every AI-powered app will probably contain a DeepSearch component somewhere in it.

And if you really want to build DeepResearch, then you'll need to know how to build DeepSearch first. One way of building deep research is simply to spin up several DeepSearch instances, and combine their answers.

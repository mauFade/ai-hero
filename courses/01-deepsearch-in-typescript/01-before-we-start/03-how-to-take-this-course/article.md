This course is going to feel quite different from courses you've taken before.

That's because this course is designed to be taken using an AI coding assistant. They'll be guiding you, writing your code for you, and helping to answer your questions.

I designed this course so that I'm the teacher but the LLM in your code editor is my teaching assistant.

## What You'll Need

I strongly recommend that you use an IDE with a built-in AI coding assistant.

We are in an era where not using one of these coding assistants gives you a significant disadvantage in terms of speed.

I'm going to be using Cursor as my main code editor, but you can use any other IDE that runs an AI coding assistant:

- VSCode with Copilot
- VSCode with Cline
- Windsurf

Or many others.

## Where Is The Code?

You won't be starting with an empty directory. I've initialized a Next.js project for you in the `courses/01-deepsearch-in-typescript/00-apps` folder of the AI Hero repo.

You'll notice that there are multiple directories. Most of you will start with the first day's directory: `01-day-1-app`. But if you've fallen behind a bit, you can start with the directory for the day you're on: `02-day-2-app`, `03-day-3-app`, etc.

## How Do I Complete The Exercises?

This course is split into many different exercises.

1. Each exercise will set up a problem we need to solve - the next step in building our DeepSearch application. These will be in video form, and in written form.

2. To solve the exercise, you'll be given a prompt to copy/paste into your coding assistant.

3. You'll guide the coding assistant through the exercise, debugging any issues and monitoring the code closely to ensure you understand what's happening.

4. Once you've reached what you think is a good solution, you'll be able to watch me walk through it in a video - explaining any fresh concepts that come up.

5. If you don't understand something, you can ask your coding assistant for help. And if they don't know the answer, ask the Discord chat for this cohort.

This problem/prompt/solution format is awesome because:

- It gets you used to dealing with coding assistants
- It keeps you focused on the high-level concepts while your assistant deals with the grunt work
- It more closely mimics the AI-assisted coding experience

### What If I Don't Want To Use A LLM?

You can still take this course if you don't use a coding assistant. The exercises are written in a human-readable format, so you can follow them without a coding assistant.

I'll be using a coding assistant to complete the exercises, but I'll be explaining the concepts in a way that you can understand even without it.

## Optional Exercises

This workshop is based around a solid core of exercises - the ones that are required for you to complete the course. There are around 3-5 of these per day.

If you just take the core exercises, you'll have built a working DeepSearch application by the end of the course.

But there are also some optional exercises - these are unlocked as you complete the core exercises for the day.

These are deeper dives, chances to experiment with different techniques, and UX tips and tricks to improve your LLM-powered apps.

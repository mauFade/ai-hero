The evals that we've written, and the ones we will write later, are the main lever through which we're going to improve our system over time.

The way we'll do this is through a concept I've explored before on the [AI Engineer Roadmap](https://www.aihero.dev/what-are-evals) called the Data Flywheel.

The Data Flywheel is a virtuous loop that happens when you track usage of your application, and use that data to improve your system.

- Users use your application
- Negative feedback are captured in traces
- Traces are used to improve evals
- Evals help you improve your application
- The product improves, driving distribution
- Higher distribution means more users

And as long as you keep a close eye on what your users are doing and implement changes based on their feedback, your app improves.

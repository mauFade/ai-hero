This document describes the writing style required for the course material.

The course is designed to be run through with an LLM - so we should be wary that a LLM will read this material and use it to automate some actions in a demonstration repo.

---

Each course file should contain three headings:

**Steps to complete:**

This describes the steps to complete. These steps should be addressed to a LLM.

**The exercise is finished when:**

Describes the exit conditions for the exercise - when the user has completed it.

**Not required yet:**

Describes the steps which are not required yet. This is necessary to prevent the LLM from doing too much work.

It may also contain other text.

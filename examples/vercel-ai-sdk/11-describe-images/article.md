Another thing that the AI SDK handles out of the box is passing images and files to LLMs.

LLMs can then look at the file or the image and do things with it. It's an extremely powerful feature.

Not all LLMs support this, but for the ones that do, AI SDK also lets you do it.

In this case, we want the LLM to generate some alt text for the image that we pass it.

We might use this alt text on a website or something to help folks who can't actually see the image understand what's in it.

# !!steps

We're going to use a pretty simple system prompt:

```ts ! example.ts
const systemPrompt =
  `You will receive an image. ` +
  `Please create an alt text for the image. ` +
  `Be concise. ` +
  `Use adjectives only when necessary. ` +
  `Do not pass 160 characters. ` +
  `Use simple language. `;
```

# !!steps

Then we're going to create a function called `describeImage` which is going to receive a path to an image on our local file system.

```ts ! example.ts
import { generateText } from "ai";

const systemPrompt =
  `You will receive an image. ` +
  `Please create an alt text for the image. ` +
  `Be concise. ` +
  `Use adjectives only when necessary. ` +
  `Do not pass 160 characters. ` +
  `Use simple language. `;

export const describeImage = async (
  imagePath: string,
) => {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: systemPrompt,
  });

  return text;
};
```

</Scrollycoding>

This looks fine, but we're not yet using the `imagePath` inside our function.

We can't pass the image path directly as a prompt; we first need to actually load the image into memory and then pass that into the `generateText` function.

<Scrollycoding>

# !!steps

To load it into memory, we're going to use `readFileSync` from Node.js.

This stores the image in memory as a `Uint8Array`, essentially a raw representation of the bytes that make up the image.

```ts ! example.ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { generateText } from "ai";

export const describeImage = async (
  imagePath: string,
) => {
  const imageAsUint8Array = readFileSync(imagePath);
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: systemPrompt,
  });

  return text;
};
```

# !!steps

We could, of course, use `readFile` from `fs.promises` if we wanted non-blocking I/O. But `readFileSync` is fine for our purposes.

```ts ! example.ts
import { readFile } from "fs/promises";
import { generateText } from "ai";

export const describeImage = async (
  imagePath: string,
) => {
  const imageAsUint8Array = await readFile(imagePath);
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: systemPrompt,
  });

  return text;
};
```

# !!steps

Now we can pass this `Uint8Array` into the `generateText` function. But we can't just pass it in as a prompt; we need to pass it in as a `messages` array:

This is in the same format as the chat history we saw before, but this time we have `content` which is an array of different message parts.

The message part that we're passing is of type `image`, and then we're passing the `Uint8Array` into the `image` property.

```ts ! example.ts
import { readFileSync } from "fs";
import { generateText } from "ai";

export const describeImage = async (
  imagePath: string,
) => {
  const imageAsUint8Array = readFileSync(imagePath);
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system: systemPrompt,
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "image",
            image: imageAsUint8Array,
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });

  return text;
};
```

Let's try running this. I've got an image of some fireworks. Let's pass it in and see what happens.

```ts
const description = await describeImage(
  "./fireworks.jpg",
);

console.log(description);
```

We get back our beautiful description:

```bash
Colorful fireworks display over a city skyline at night, with bursts of red, white, and blue reflections on the water. Spectators watch from the shoreline.
```

To sum up, we read an image into memory, passed it directly into `generateText` via the `messages` array, and got back a description of that image. Pretty sweet.

## Reading From A URL

Our current approach works if you have the file in memory. But what if you only have a URL to the file?

Well, there's a really nice shortcut - You can pass the URL directly to the AI SDK.

```ts
import { generateText } from "ai";

export const describeImage = async (
  imageUrl: string,
) => {
  const { text } = await generateText({
    model,
    system:
      `You will receive an image. ` +
      `Please create an alt text for the image. ` +
      `Be concise. ` +
      `Use adjectives only when necessary. ` +
      `Do not pass 160 characters. ` +
      `Use simple language. `,
    messages: [
      {
        role: "user",
        content: [
          {
            type: "image",
            image: new URL(imageUrl),
          },
        ],
      },
    ],
  });

  return text;
};
```

We're wrapping the URL with `new URL` to indicate to the AI SDK that this is a URL on the web that we want to send along to the LLM.

Let's test it out. We've got an image of a church that we wanted to describe, that I've hosted on GitHub:

```ts
const description = await describeImage(
  "https://github.com/ai-hero-dev/ai-hero/blob/main/internal/assets/image.jpg?raw=true",
);

console.log(description);
```

When we run this, it's going to pass the URL to the LLM. The LLM will then download the image and have a look at it. And then we get back our description.

```bash
Lake Bled in Slovenia with church on small peninsula and castle on cliff, surrounded by mountains. Calm water reflects buildings and autumn trees.
```

This is a really great way to take a shortcut when you're working with images hosted on the web.

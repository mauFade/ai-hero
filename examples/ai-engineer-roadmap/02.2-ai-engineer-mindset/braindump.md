Want to express the AI engineers is essentially experimental.

Instead of working with a deterministic system, you're working with a probabilistic system.

Whole days may end up being a failure. Your job will be to essentially exhaust avenues of potential improvement.

Because AI engineer is experimental. You need to really clearly define your success criteria.

## Success Criteria

If you can't define your success criteria, you'll never know when you succeeded.

If your success criteria is based on accuracy, it's unrealistic to expect that you'll be 100% accurate all the time.

## Data Is Important

AI engineering is also different because it requires a high level of data fluency. You need to understand how important data is to your application.

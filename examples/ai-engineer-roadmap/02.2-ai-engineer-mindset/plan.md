# The AI Engineer's Journey: Why Building AI Apps Is Different

After choosing your LLM based on metrics like cost and latency, you'll discover something surprising: building AI apps is fundamentally different from traditional software development. This article explains why - and sets up why you'll need evals to succeed.

## Article Style Note

This plan uses headings to organize our thoughts, but the final article should flow as a continuous narrative with minimal headings. Instead of explicit section breaks:

- Use strong transitional paragraphs between concepts
- Let the two visualizations serve as natural break points in the narrative
- Use short paragraphs and clear topic sentences to maintain readability

## 1. The Reality of AI Development (200 words)

### Key Visualizations

1. **"How Good AI Apps Get Built" Graph**

   - Illustrates the critical "Vibes-Only Trough" to "Eval Slope" progression
   - Shows key milestones: initial launch, model iterations, adding evals
   - Demonstrates why systematic evaluation becomes necessary

2. **"AI Engineering Is Experimental" Graph**
   - Shows the volatile nature of quality over time
   - Illustrates how experiments lead to both improvements and setbacks
   - Reinforces why "vibes-based" development isn't enough

### Core Concepts

- Why benchmarks aren't enough in production
- The inevitability of experimental development
  <braindump>Instead of working with a deterministic system, you're working with a probabilistic system.</braindump>
  <braindump>Whole days may end up being a failure. Your job will be to essentially exhaust avenues of potential improvement.</braindump>

## 2. Defining your success criteria (200 words)

- The problem with manual testing
- Why intuition breaks down at scale
- The need for systematic evaluation
  <braindump>If you can't define your success criteria, you'll never know when you succeeded.</braindump>
  <braindump>Because AI engineer is experimental. You need to really clearly define your success criteria.</braindump>

## 3. Data Is Important (200 words)

- Moving beyond manual testing
- Building feedback loops
- Why data fluency matters
  <braindump>AI engineering is also different because it requires a high level of data fluency. You need to understand how important data is to your application.</braindump>
  <braindump>If your success criteria is based on accuracy, it's unrealistic to expect that you'll be 100% accurate all the time.</braindump>

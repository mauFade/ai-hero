# Feeling MCP FOMO? This will help...

The Model Context Protocol (MCP) is the **USB-C of AI**.

It's a standard, released by Anthropic, that lets you **plug-and-play different toolsets into your AI-powered apps**. It makes Cursor, Windsurf, and Claude Code even more powerful.

MCP servers for GitHub, Slack, and more are already available. But how do you get started?

My new [Model Context Protocol tutorial](https://www.aihero.dev/model-context-protocol-tutorial) will give you everything you need to know to get started.

You'll learn:

- Why the Model Context Protocol exists
- Building MCP Servers in TypeScript
- Distributing MCP Servers on NPM
- Hosting MCP Servers on serverless platforms

By the end, you will be able to **ship your MCP idea** so that anyone around the world will be able to use it.

And best of all, **it's free**.

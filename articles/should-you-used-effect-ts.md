Effect TS is selling itself as a really great way to structure AI apps.

This feels to me like a bit of bandwagon jumping. Effect is very compelling for certain use cases. The fact that it bundles up so much stuff into a standard library is pretty nice.

But it's a huge learning curve for what you can patch together with a bunch of other JavaScript libraries which people already know.

Personally, I don't see the particular appeal of using Effect with AI. Especially since the AI chains are not particularly complicated.

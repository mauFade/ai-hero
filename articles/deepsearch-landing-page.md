# Your Job As A Developer Is Evolving Faster Than You Can Imagine

Pandora's Box has been opened. AI is here.

The rate of change is accelerating. New developments are coming thick and fast.

You’ve been thinking “will I still be doing this in 5 years?”.

Doom-mongers are screaming “software development is over”.

Hype merchants are selling utopia.

Who will you listen to?

## Your Skills Are Valuable

Let me tell you a secret. The real differentiator of great AI apps isn't the how good the AI is. It's the how good the UX is (it's always the UX).

That means that the skills you have already - TypeScript, web development, product design - are more valuable than ever.

But in this new era, they need to be paired with the right AI Engineer skills. That means learning:

- AI Observability
- Evals
- Dataset management
- AI System Design

Without these, you'll never get past the "vibes" stage of AI apps.

## Learn By Shipping

The only way to learn is by doing. So, my first AI Hero course is a ten-day deep dive into building a real-world AI app, in TypeScript.

We'll be building a DeepSearch app - a question-answering app that answers questions about a custom dataset.

It's a pattern at the core of many AI apps - from customer support chatbots to document summarization.

It's the perfect conversion course for TypeScript web developers who want to get into AI.

## A Course For The AI Era

But we won't just be learning how to build AI-powered apps. We'll be turning you into an AI-powered developer.

This is my first AI-native course: every exercise comes with a prompt that guides you through to the solution. Got stuck? Ask your IDE a clarifying question.

That means it's not just me teaching you - your IDE is your teaching assistant.

## Better Together

You won't be learning alone. You'll have a crew of other adventurers to tackle the challenges with - and office hours with me to help you out.

We'll be running this course in cohorts. Each day for ten days, you'll unlock a new set of challenges to complete.

And for the daring few, they'll be dozens of optional side quests to complete. More time for experimentation, exploration and fun.

What's up Wizards, I have got a treat for you today.

I've been building a lot of stuff with TypeScript and AI recently.

I've been building agents, workflows, custom scripts and CLIs to help me work faster and smarter.

And Vercel's AI SDK has been an awesome tool in my toolkit.

## What is the Vercel AI SDK?

It's a library that solves a lot of the pain points when working with LLMs.

And in this video, I'm going to give you a full tutorial on how to get to grips with it.

We're going to cover:

- Prompting streaming text
- Structured outputs
- Handling images and files
- Tool calling
- Building agents

Is this a sponsored video? No.

You don't need to pay Vercel any money to use the AI SDK.

You don't need a cloud platform. You don't even need to use `Next.js`.

You can use the AI SDK anywhere JavaScript runs. And that's why I'm so excited about it. It's so versatile, so powerful and it's just the right level of abstraction for almost any task.

## What's In This Video?

This video is split into sixteen different parts. Each part teaches you one or two things about the AI SDK.

If you want access to the code, I strongly recommend you look at the hosted version on my site AI Hero instead.

It's got all the code samples, links to a GitHub repo you can download to run it locally.

And it splits up all the videos into individual URLs so that you can reference them easily.

So if you want that, go to the description below and head there now.

But if you want the full YouTube experience, let's freaking go.

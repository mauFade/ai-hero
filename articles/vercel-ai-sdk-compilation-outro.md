And that, folks, is my Vercel AI SDK series.

If you are hungry for more there is only one place I can recommend you go and that is ai hero.

While I've been filming this I've been planning out my curriculum for the course.

We're going to cover all sorts of stuff from evals to prompt engineering to rag to agents.

And in the future I'll be diving into creating your own coding agents and getting the most out of existing tools like cursor.

But I'm mostly just really thankful to you for getting to the end of my longest video ever.

This really has been a tonne of work to put together and if you've enjoyed it then please subscribe please leave a like.

And if you want more of this stuff then sign up to my newsletter on ai hero.

Thank you so much for joining along and I will see you in the next one.
